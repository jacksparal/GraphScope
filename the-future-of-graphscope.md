# The future of GraphScope

According to our plan, the GraphScope is to be open-sourced by December 2020[^1] under Apache License 2.0. Here at Alibaba, we are fully committed to the long-term active development and maintenance of the project. We aim for a major release every 6 months with new features and improvements. Following the initial release, the following new capabilities are planned for the next major release around June 2021[^1], please stay tuned : 

1. NetworkX-API support 
2. A persistent dynamic graph storage 
3. Performance improvement over runtime and compiler modules 
4. Java SDK for developing analytics algorithms 

We also pledge to foster an open and welcoming graph computing community around the project. We encourage everyone to try and contribute to GraphScope to improve this project.
