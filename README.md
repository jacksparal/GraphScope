    A One-Stop Large-Scale Graph Computing System from Alibaba
</p>

GraphScope is a unified distributed graph computing platform that provides a one-stop environment for performing diverse graph operations on a cluster of computers through a user-friendly Python interface. GraphScope makes multi-staged processing of large-scale graph data on compute clusters simple by combining several important pieces of Alibaba technology: including [Graph Analytics Engine (GAE)](https://github.com/alibaba/libgrape-lite), Graph Interactive Engine (GIE), and [Graph Learning Engine (GLE)](https://github.com/alibaba/graph-learn) for analytical, interactive, and graph-based machine learning computation, respectively, and the [vineyard](https://github.com/alibaba/libvineyard) store that offers efficient in-memory data transfers.

We will release GraphScope 1.0 as open source under the Apache 2.0 license soon.
